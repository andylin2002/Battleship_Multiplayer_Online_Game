This is a classic two-player pen-and-paper battle game. In the past, players had to redraw grids or erase previous game records every time they played, which made the experience less enjoyable. Now, with computer networking, you can easily place your ships using the mouse, automatically check if a missile hits the opponent's ship, and quickly start a new round.
